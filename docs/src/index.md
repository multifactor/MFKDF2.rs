# MFKDF2: Multi-Factor Key Derivation Function

Multi-Factor Key Derivation Function (MFKDF2) is a modern, highly-secure function designed to derive cryptographic keys from multiple inputs, or "factors". It serves a similar purpose to traditional password-based key derivation functions (PBKDFs) like Argon2 or scrypt, but offers significantly stronger security guarantees by natively supporting a wide range of authentication factors.

> **About this Book:**  
> This documentation is built with [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) and is your primary resource for learning about MFKDF2. You'll find guides on using the crate, generating and working with bindings, development notes, feature descriptions, and a roadmap for future improvements.
