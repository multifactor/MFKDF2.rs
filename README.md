# MFKDF2: Multi-Factor Key Derivation Function

Multi-Factor Key Derivation Function (MFKDF2) is a modern, highly-secure function designed to derive cryptographic keys from multiple inputs, or "factors". It serves a similar purpose to traditional password-based key derivation functions (PBKDFs) like Argon2 or scrypt, but offers significantly stronger security guarantees by natively supporting a wide range of authentication factors.

This repository contains the canonical Rust implementation of MFKDF2, with a focus on security, performance, and multi-language support through generated bindings.

> [!WARNING]
> This is not production-ready. Please do not use it in production. Please report any security vulnerabilities to the project maintainers.

## Features

- **Multi-Factor Security**: Go beyond simple passwords. MFKDF2 natively supports factors like:
  - Passwords
  - HOTP (HMAC-based One-Time Password)
  - TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
  - Hardware tokens (e.g., YubiKey)
- **Self-Service Account Recovery**: Implement K-of-N secret sharing policies, allowing users to recover accounts without centralized recovery keys.
- **Flexible Policies**: Define arbitrarily complex key derivation policies to meet your specific security requirements.
- **Cross-Language Support**: Core logic is written in Rust, with bindings for other languages like TypeScript, Python, and more.
- **Secure by Design**: Built with modern cryptographic primitives and a strong focus on security best practices.

## Roadmap

For this library to be considered fully production-ready, the following items should be addressed:

- **Complete Factor Implementation**: Not all proposed MFKDF2 factors have been implemented (e.g., fuzzy encryption, QR,  etc.).
- **Features**: Not all mfkdf features have been implemented.
  - Modes of operation: mfchf, mfdpg
  - Derived key features (strengthen, reconstitution, persistence, hints, etc.)
- **Comprehensive Tests**: While basic tests are in place, more extensive testing is needed, including:
  - Differential testing against the reference JavaScript implementation.
- **Complete Language Bindings**: While the framework is in place, bindings for languages like Python, Kotlin, Swift, and Go are not yet complete.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation and usage examples have not been set up yet.
- **Detailed `CONTRIBUTING.md`**: A more detailed guide for contributors.
- **Formal Security Audit**: The library has not yet undergone a formal, third-party security audit.

## Project Layout

This repository is structured as a workspace with several crates:

- `mfkdf2`: The core Rust library containing the MFKDF2 implementation.
  - `derive`: factor derive construction
  - `setup`: factor setup construction
  - `definitions`: necessary types required for MFKDF2 key derivation
  - `policy`: MFKDF2 policy construction
  - `crypto`: utility cryptography module
- `mfkdf2-web`: TypeScript/WASM bindings for use in web browsers and Node.js.
- `mfkdf2-py`: Python bindings for the core library.

## Installation

To use `mfkdf2` in your Rust project, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
mfkdf2 = { version = "0.1.0", git = "https://github.com/multifactor/mfkdf2.rs.git" }
```

This will be updated to a published version once the library is ready for production.

## Setup

1. Make sure [rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install) is installed.
2. We use [just](https://github.com/casey/just#cross-platform) for managing project specific build commands.
3. TS Bindings require [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to be installed

### Bindings

This library uses [UniFFI](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/) to generate bindings for other languages.

**TypeScript/WASM:**

1.  Ensure you have the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` Rust toolchain installed:
    ```bash
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    ```
2.  Generate the bindings:
    ```bash
    just gen-ts-bindings
    ```
3.  Run tests to verify the bindings:
    ```bash
    just test-bindings
    ```

See more details in the [mfkdf2-web README](mfkdf2-web/README.md).

**Python:**

To generate Python bindings, run the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin uniffi-bindgen generate --library target/debug/libmfkdf2.dylib --language python --out-dir mfkdf2-py/src
```

## Usage

*Note: The following is a conceptual example. The exact API may differ.*

```rust
use mfkdf2::{derive, setup};
use mfkdf2::setup::{factors::hotp::HOTPOptions, password::PasswordOptions, key::MFKDF2Options};
use mfkdf2::derive::factors::{hotp::HOTPOptions, password::PasswordOptions};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // 1. Define factors
    let password_factor = setup::password("my-super-secret-password", PasswordOptions::default())?;
    let totp_factor = setup::hotp("base32-encoded-secret", HOTPOptions::default())?;

    // 2. Set up the key with the policy
    let key = setup::key(vec![password_factor, totp_factor], MFKDF2Options::default())?;

    println!("Key: {:?}", key);

    // 3. Derive the key using user inputs
    let derived_key = derive::key(key.policy, vec![
        derive::factors::password("my-super-secret-password")?,
        derive::factors::hotp("123456")?, // User-provided TOTP code
    ])?;

    println!("Derived Key: {:?}", derived_key);

    Ok(())
}
```
